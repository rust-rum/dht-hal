Digital humidity and temperature sensors (DHT) from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com)
are widely used especially in different kind of DIY projects.

This driver supports next sensors revisions: DHT11, DHT21, DHT22.

I have tested it on Raspberry Pi 3 and STM32 Blue Pill board.
All platform specific implementations are available in examples directory.
